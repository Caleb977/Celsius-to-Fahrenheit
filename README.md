# Celsius-to-Fahrenheit
When RÃ©mi came to the US (to visit Petra to make this MOOC) he brought his favorite cookie recipe! When trying to bake the cookies he realized that ovens in the US show temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, but the cookie recipe called for a temperature in degrees Celsius. We need your help!
